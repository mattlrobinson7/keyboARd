								<h2>Week 3</h3>
								<h5>April 14, 2016</h5>
								<p>Since the first Origami demo provided by the Holographic Academy, we have tried to download existing piano/keyboard assets online and place them in our project. Unfortunately, we had no luck looking for a reusable asset that suits to the purpose of our application. In the coming week, we will try to build our own custom keyboard asset using Unity cubes.</p>

								<p>Although we weren’t able to use the existing assets as they were, we had a chance to experiment with them to figure out how close a user can get to a hologram. Matt’s arms were long enough to touch the keyboards when stretched, but the problem is that no one plays the piano with his/her elbows straight. Would it be possible to induce the users to play the ‘free play’ mode without directly looking at the keyboard?</p>


								<p><b>Plans for the week</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Field trip to Microsoft!</li>
										<li>Try to build our own keyboard asset with cubes</li>
										<li>Resize the custom keyboard asset to the physical keyboard we are using</li>
										<li>Finalize the features we want in our application</li>
									</ul>
									<div class="image blog"><img src="images/team.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								</p>

								<p><b>What we are doing</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Josh: Experimenting with the field of vision issue</li>
										<li>Seokmin: Creating a 3d keyboard using Unity</li>
										<li>Hayoun: Experimenting with 3d mapping in Hololens</li>
										<li>Matt: Experimenting with key highlighting; Editing the video clip for the team</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h2>Week 4</h3>
								<h5>April 21, 2016</h5>
								<p>Currently for KeyboARd, we’re trying to make sure our application will work as we intended. We’ve decided to not buy a keyboard model, but instead make one ourselves.</p> 

								<p>A keyboard is essentially multiple white rectangles with black rectangles stacked on top of them. By creating the model ourselves we allow easier piano customization if needed as opposed to trying to understand how to add on to other people’s models.</p> 
								
								<p>Currently, the team is in investigation mode to ensure that we are able to create KeyboARd successfully despite possible restrictions caused by the Hololens. So far so good, we feel that we should be able to place our holo-piano on our physical piano and the restricted vision shouldn’t be a major problem.</p> 
								
								<p>Next week, our goal is to integrate our new MIDI keyboard to Unity and have our model keyboard light up when we hit the corresponding key. We also have to create some sort of representation for our music so our users can play a song.</p>

								<p><b>What we are doing:</b>
									 MIDI integration with keyboard and create a simple song to test with
									<ul>
										<li>Josh: Work with Keyboard MIDI integration</li>
										<li>Seokmin: Work with Keyboard MIDI integration</li>
										<li>Hayoun: Explore reading MIDI files for songs</li>
										<li>Matt: Create simple song and work on lighting up keyboard</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<hr />
								
								<h2>Week 5</h3>
								<h5>April 27, 2016</h5>
								
								<p>This was a big week for us in the holographic world. Looking back to a week ago, all we had was a static piano model that we made, a keyboard that didn’t do anything yet, and high hopes. However, this week we made a ton of progress. As of now, a simple song (Mary had a Little Lamb) lights up the keys and the notes rain in from the distance.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/keyboardGif.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We also were able to connect the physical keyboard to the hololens via the networking tools in unity and get them to communicate with one another. Now when a user opens the app, they can press keys on the physical keyboard and receive visual feedback on whether or not the right note is being played based on the color that comes up. Green for correct key pressed and red for incorrect key pressed.</p>
								<p>A huge victory for the week was today when Hayoun figured out how to read in a MIDI file that we found online, parse it and extract the notes that were supposed to be played, and make it successfully light up the keyboard playing Beethoven’s Fur Elise.</p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/sequencer.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is a huge opportunity for us to have hundreds or thousands of songs available. Instead of hard coding songs, with a little more work we can download a midi file from anywhere and have it work with our system. </p>
								<p>Our goals for the rest of this week and next week include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Positioning virtual keyboard on top of actual keyboard.</li>
									<li>Determine best way to handle more advanced songs.
									<ul>
										<li>Right now we can only work with songs that play one note at a time</li>
									</ul></li>
									<li>Continue work on MIDI reading.
									<ul>
										<li>Fixing minor glitches in generating KeyColor</li>
										<li>Integrating MusicRain and the MIDI reader</li>
									</ul></li>
									<li>Create Simple menu.
									<ul>
										<li>Select Song (If all goes well with MIDI)</li>
										<li>Start button</li>
									</ul></li>
									<li>Ability to restart song.
									<ul>
										<li>Currently we have to re-launch the application in order to restart</li>
									</ul></li>
									<li>Key press feedback accuracy and effects.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We're looking forward to seeing what comes this next week and how well we can figure out these issues!</p>

								<h2>Week 6</h3>
								<h5>May 5, 2016</h5>

								<p>We had another awesome week getting some pretty big things figured out for our project. Most of the week we were stuck on how to corrrectly move the keyboard using the TapToPlace script from the HoloToolkit but on Tuesday we solved that issue, which of course presented us with a new issue. When the keyboard was placed, it seemed to make the music rain from the original spot of the keyboard and move toward the new spot which looked very bad and was pretty much unusable. However, in the last 30 minutes of lab, our team found a solution using some intense trigonometry. Essesntially when we rotated the keyboard in whatever way, we needed to make sure that the distance from the keys to where the rain started was 1 meter. That was the hypotenuse of our triangle and using the angle of the rotation in the Y axis, we were able to adjust our x and z position transforms to correctly handle this rotation.</p>

								<p>We also made great progress in to reading in a MIDI file and if that can work out, we will have access to any song we can find a file for to play on the piano.</p>

								<p>For next week, our goal is to incorporate voice commands, allow for a manual positioning of the keyboard using some of the keys to incrementally move the keyboard to the right spot, and if there is time, to use a wav file for each of the notes which can be played though the hololens speakers when a note is pressed, and figure out a better way to show a user a note is coming and get ready to press it.</p>

								<p>To do this: Seokmin and Matt will begin work on voice commands, Josh will work on manually placing the keyboard, and Hayoun will finish up the MIDI work and start on finding wav files for the sounds.</p>

								<p>We are very pleased with our progress so far and can't wait to get working on the next part of the project!</p>
								

							<hr />
								
								<h2>Week 7</h3>
								<h5>May 12, 2016</h5>

								<p>This week we got a lot of really key (pun intended) items completed. To summarize, we implemented voice commands, we allowed for the manual fine tuning of the keyboard location, we completely redesigned the way we go about lighting up keys, (we made the keys light up using collision detection instead of timing which was causing some errors when the tempo is sped up or slowed down), experimented with different ways of giving users cues as to which notes are approaching and coming next, and we made the music rain work with the processed midi files, and most importantly we got sounds working in the hololens headset.</p>

								<p>Here are some examples of what the midi files read in with rain currently look like: </p>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/midiRain.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/Keyboard.gif" alt="" /></div>


								<p>Having the MIDI work will be a really cool feature becuase it will alow playing more complex songs and just more songs in genere. However, we realize how important it is for the demo to have at least one very simple song working that can be very successful. We are pretty close to getting midi hooked up with the actual application itself, and by thinking about things at a high level to begin with, the integration should be pretty straight-forward.</p>

								<p>For this week, Josh will be working on a main menu UI and determining the best way to go about showing users which fingers to use (whether that will be hand models or numbers on keys). Hayoun will be thinking about and implementing a better classes for rain since right now it's kind of hacky and a cleaner solution will be very nice to have. Seokmin will be finding a smart way to handle music rain created by midi sequencer and hooking that up to the actual application. Matt will be working on the timing between the music rain and the key light up, making a better way to handle songs that are a little trickier (the system currently can handle songs that play one note at a time and for 1 unit of time at a time), and fine tuning the keyboard.</p>

								<h2>Week 9 KeyboARd Update</h2>		
								<h5>May 19, 2016</h5>
								
								<p>
									After all the troubles we had last week with our repository not working and having to basically recreate that, we actually ended up having a very productive week. We implemented more manual adjustment controls for the keyboard, made the keyboard fade away once it’s placed so all you see are the lights, fixed an issue with the timing of the key light up, created a main menu UI, downloaded some more simple songs, created a tutorial to teach users how to use the app, and are working towards making the keyboard placement happen only one time and having that position persist through every scene so the user never has to worry about picking up and placing the keyboard themselves.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									The toughest issue that we faced this week was the timing of the key light up. The problem arose because with the midi files, not all notes are the same length and because of that, the music rain would come out of the front of the keyboard and the note would stop lighting up too early. We figured out that because the position of the notes are measured from their centers, using some math would allow us to determine if the top of the music rain was at the top of the key (signifying that the note was done). To solve the issue of the music rain running through the front of the keyboard, we created a “cover” that was completely black and all of the notes ran out of the keyboard under it. So that when someone is using it in the hololens, the cover looks transparent but all the notes below it are occluded.

								</p>
								
								<p>
									This week will be our time to double down our efforts in order to make the dress rehearsal demo look polished. Our goal is to make the UI cleaner and simpler, use a hand model for our tutorial, focus really hard on figuring out position persisting across multiple scenes so that the piano only has to be set once, and lots of play testing.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Josh will be working on the UI and connecting all of the scenes together in a clean manner. Seokmin is working on the position persisting of the virtual keyboard. Hayoun is working with the hand model to help in the tutorial. And Matt is putting the finishing touches on the tutorial, starting the final video, and beginning work on the UI as well.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									We hope that the demo next week goes very well and we expect it to, but it will also be good for us to get a lot of eyes on our project so that we can have everything perfectly polished when it comes time for our real demo on the 9th.
								</p>

								<h2>Week 10 KeyboARd Update</h2>		
								<h5>June 3, 2016</h5>
								
								<p>
									From the user testing experience we had with our demo. We've decided to make some changes:
								</p>
								
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>Without any guidance from us, users didn't really know how to look down to the keyboard from the menu and vice versa when performing the next steps. </li>
										<ul>
											<li>To fix this, we’re going to create arrows that will show the users where they have to look</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Having to adjust the virtual keyboard every time we run into problems takes up a lot of time. </li>
										<ul>
											<li>Luckily, one of the HoloLens developers told us about Anchor Points which will keep our keyboard positioned in the same location. We hope by integrating anchor points we will have a more consistent experience</li>
										</ul>

										<li>We need more keyboards. Currently we can only have users test one at a time</li>
										<ul>
											<li>We will get another keyboard to allow us to have 2 people try our app at a time. To do this we need</li>
											<ul>
												<li>3 computers. 2 will be a server to detect keyboard hits and 1 to display our video. </li>
												<li>We will need 2 Ethernet cables for 2 of our computers</li>
												<li>4 HoloLens, 2 for use and 2 for backup</li>
												<li>Another keyboard stand</li>
											</ul>
											<li>We’re also considering setting up a sign in sheet to reserve spots so that people who are waiting can look around and we can call them back when it’s their turn</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Stereo System to attract more people</li>
										<ul>
											<li>One thing people have always asked us if we had any sound not knowing that only the users will hear the sound. We intend to make it more fun (and attract people) by broadcasting what everyone is playing on a stereo</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Integrate a score system with a white board leaderboard to make games competitive for the user and to drive more traffic to our app</li>
										<ul>
											<li>We’ll make a score system that will track how many notes that the user hits correctly and we’ll have a high score white board that we will have to keep everyone’s score</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Fix a bug with the scale when the user plays 2 notes quickly so that they are played almost at the same time that the app won’t continue anymore</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Overall the demo was a fun learning experience and we have a lot of work ahead of us to attract more people and create a smoother and fun game experience!
