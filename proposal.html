								<h2>Problem Sapce</h3>
								<p>Playing the piano incorporates many unnatural skills that would scare any beginners away, such as using both hands, sight-reading their music, and recognizing musical symbols. Struggling with their hand-eye coordination, lack of ability to respond to auditory stimuli, and the music notation for their right hand that is different from the one for their left hand, beginners can be easily intimidated.</p>
								<hr />

								<h2>Applications</h3>
								<p>Playing the piano is a joy, but when it becomes time to practice music pieces, the experience becomes more frustrating where:</p>

								<h5>Expensive and/or Difficult to Start Learning</h5>
								<p>For complete beginners, they have to spend a lot of time and energy to learn how to play music or they have to hire an expensive private tutor to teach them.</p>
								<h5>Learn New Songs Faster</h5>
								<p>Practicing new songs can be a frustrating experience. Players are unfamiliar with what notes to play, where the keys are in the piano, and along with all of that, think about scales and other music theories that make music great, while frustrating for the players to learn.</p>
								<hr />

								<h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
								<p>To learn to play the piano, beginners can hire a private tutor, try to learn online, or download piano playing software like Synthesia. We at KeyboARd feel that these options are either expensive, inaccessible or inefficient, especially for beginners. However with the introduction of new AR technology, we believe we have found the solution to revolutionize learning to play the piano.</p>
								<hr />

								<h2>Content</h2>
								<p>KeyboARd is an AR piano application that will map a virtual keyboard onto your real piano keyboard. Similar to Synthesia, KeyboARd will assist pianist in playing the piano by having notes fly down to the keyboard to indicate when and which notes to play. KeyboARd throws away the painful parts of having to do 3 things at once just to play simple song. Instead our goal is to help beginners do what they want: play the songs they love without having to understand music theory.</p>

								<p>Alongside with being able assist in playing music, KeyboARd will be able to give lessons to players, follow them to learn how to play the piano at their own pace. KeyboARd will act as a personal private tutor that will be available whenever the player wants to learn.</p>
								<hr />

								<h2>Method</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Keyboard Mapping</li>
									<li>Unity 3d model</li>
									<li>Object collision detection using Kinect motion sensor</li>
									<li>Text-based music stored in the database</li>
								</ol>

								<h2>Example Scenarios</h3>

								<h5>Complete Beginner Brian</h5>
								<p>Brian who doesn’t have previous experience in either piano or music tries to learn how to play piano. Without having any private tutors or anyone helping him, he struggles so much because he doesn’t even know where to start. KeyboARd can be a great solution to Brian because it will cover from the basic concepts of piano to advanced piano skills. KeyboARd will introduce Brian to the world of music at his own pace with the built-in music tutor that Brian can follow along. After using this application, Brian will gain the keyboarding skills and music knowledge needed to be able to play the piano by himself.</p>
								<h5>Intermediate level music student Ida</h5>
								<p>Different from Brian, Ida has some experience with music and piano and would like to improve her piano skills so that she can play more advanced song. However, getting a tutor is not affordable to her, but she has a hololens at home that she uses daily life. Ida can slowly read and play the music on her own, but always get frustrated with how slow she’s progressing all while playing inaudible music. With KeyboARd, Ida can easily identify the music note to hit on her piano, she would be able to get the practice she needs while enjoying the song she wants. By slowing down the speed of the song, she can become more comfortable with it and gradually work her way up to full speed proficiency. </p>

								<h2>Resource Budget</h2>
								<p>To create KeyboARd we would need:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api">Microsoft vision API ($0-10)</a></li>
									<li><a href=" https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14068">Hand model for lessons ($25)</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17964">Musical notes for effects ($~25)</a></li>
									<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01686TYOC/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_nNvbxb138F7XH">Electronic keyboard (~$100-200)</a></li>
									<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UIS53K/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_NOvbxb1FJAAD5">Kinect ($300)</a></li>
								</ul>
